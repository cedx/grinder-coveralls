# Usage
If you haven't used [Grinder](https://github.com/google/grinder.dart) before, be sure to check out the [related documentation](https://google.github.io/grinder.dart), as it explains how to create a `grind.dart` file and to define project tasks. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install the plug-in.
